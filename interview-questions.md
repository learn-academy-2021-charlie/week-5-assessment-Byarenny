# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: While I know MVC stands for model-view-controller, I cant recall what that exactly means. I will do some research on that and get back to you.

  Researched answer: Model-view-controller is a framework that provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. 



2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is a database that holds data related to other data such as rows and columns. There are other kinds of databases that are non relational but I will have to look up the exact names of those types of databases.

  Researched answer: A relational database stores data in tables with rows and columns. The relationship between the datatables and fields is called a schema. Relational databases are also called SQL databases. A non-relational database does not use rows and columns, it is usually just the data and the key or type of data it is storing. These databases are known as NoSQL.
  There are four types of NoSQL databases, Document-oriented, Key-Value Stores, Wide-Column Stores, and Graphs Stores.



3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: Object-relational mapping is being able to access a particular piece of data from a database using commands like SELECT, FROM, ORDER BY etc.

  Researched answer: Object-relational mapping is coverting data between two incompatible languages in object-oriented programming.



4. What is a gem?

  Your answer: What I can recall about gem is that it is a library that holds code to be able to be installed.

  Researched answer: A library of code functionality that makes it easy to share with others, you install gems by using the command $ gem install .



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: I believe primary keys are related to databases but I can't recall the exact relation at this moment, I will be happy to look into it and get back to you on that one.

  Researched answer: Primary keys are used to ID each row in a program. We can assign an ID # as a unique identifer to prevent any mix ups in a datatable.
